# Testing
## Alpha Testing:
- Alpha testing goals/checklist:
  - The program runs
  - The program does not bug out or have an error message
  - Contacts are succesfully displayed to the user
  - More contacts can be added
- Multiple breif tests were done by peers throughout CS30, giving breif results and opninions on what they would like to see with the program:
  - Be able to close the program and restart while saving to contacts from the original execution.
  - Be able to delete individual contacts, not only all of them.
  - Have a section where you could place more information about a contact.
  - Fix a multitude of error messages and bugs
- NOTE: All the above recommendations were successfully coded and conducted within the program as of 1/18/22
## Beta Testing
- 3 CS30 beta testers used this beta checklist on 1/19/22:
  - The program runs, and all options work in a varying order.
  - The program was clear and concise, if it was unclear, a referral to the "Readme.md" file was helpful and solved the issue
  - No bugs or error messaged were noticed from start to stop of the program.
  - Contacts were successfully saved to the "SAVED_CONTACTS.txt" file.
  - On a program restart, previous contacts are still used and appear to the user
## Beta test results:
## Ashish:
- Ashish replied yes to all of the checklist.
- Feedback:
  - Say that there are no contacts available to modify when there are 0 contacts.
