# User Manual
## Quick Start/Stop:
- Use the green "Run" button to begin the program
- Use the grey "Stop" button to stop the program. Contacts will not save in this way.
## Main Menu Navigation:
- Enter '1' to view current contacts. If nothing but a list comes up, you have not entered any contacts and will need to return to the main menu. Otherwise, you can select to return back to the original menu before this screen. Entering '2' will delete all contacts. If entering '1', please refer to "Editing a Contact" 
- Enter '2' to manually add a new contact and fill out all the information.
- Enter '3' to save all your contacts onto the "SAVED_CONTACTS.txt" file. As well, this will close the program and permanently delete any contacts that were deleted during the run of the program.
- Enter '4' to quickly create 3 new pre-selected contacts. This is used for testing. This will only work once for each run of the program. It is not recommended to repeatedly use this, as it will continue adding the same contacts.
## Editing a Contact:
- When executed, a number will show up above each of your contacts. Enter the number above to edit the contact below.
- Afterwards, entering '1', '2', '3' or '4' will allow you to change that specific section of the contact. '5' will delete that contact entirely.
